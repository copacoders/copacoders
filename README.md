# copacodersclub

This project contains the official website for the [Copa Coders](https://copacoders.club), a [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com/) and affiliated [Code Club](https://codeclub.org)s located in [Maricopa, AZ](https://www.latlong.net/c/?lat=33.074192&long=-112.014835).

## Purpose

This website is provided as a simple platform for dojo partitipants (ninjas) to showcase their HTML 5 skills as well as provide a mechanism for learning to work inside of a team environment using [Git](https://git-scm/com) on the popular [GitHub](https://github.com) platform.

## How to Contribute

Ninjas and other contributors are encouraged to fork the project from which they should create their pull requests. This accomplishes several things, including:

1. Helps ninjas learn how to contribute to the open source community as individual contributors
2. Learn to create pull requests and appropriate documentation, both in-line and in commits
3. Practice maintaining forks, logging issues, participating in code reviews, etc.

For those interested in collaborating on the project directly, please [message us](https://m.me/copacoders) or visit [our Facebook page](https://fb.me/copacoders). Only members of the Dojo, both ninjas and mentors, may join the project.

### SOFTWARE REQUIRED

1. Git client of your choice
2. Text editor of your choice (may include Git client)

That's it! We highly recommend [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for programmers new and experienced alike. This can be paired with Git for your platform here: https://www.git-scm.com/downloads to maintain your code in one program.

### NINJA SHOWCASE REQUIREMENTS

Before submitting your pull request, please ensure:

1. All files pertaining to your showcase should stay inside the /showcase directory. Multi-page showcases inside their own subdirectories underneath /showcase/.
2. Only one link is included for your showcase. Your fork should include a modification of /index.html placed at the end of the ``<ul>`` in the section starting with ``<!-- Begin ninja showcase link list -->``. No other modifications to /index.html will be accepted for ninja showcases.
3. Links should be placed in order of contribution. If we receive multiple pull requests at the same time, they will be ordered as pull requests are received on GitHub. Links should include your name or GitHub username, a title and, importantly, a link to the showcase.
4. Don't forget to watch your GitHub account notifications for feedback or your pull request may be rejected.

## Changes to our website

Please note that upon accepting any pull requests, changes will still need to be merged. Our webserver will also have to sync with GitHub. Further, we have a manually executed script to deploy changes from the Git repository. You will be notified when your changes go live on our website but please be patient as it may take several days, depending on the volume of pull requests we are dealing with.
