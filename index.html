        <h1>COPA CODERS</h1>
        <p>This is the official website for the <strong>COPA CODERS</strong>, a <a href="https://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojo</a> with several affiliated <a href="https://codeclub.org/en">Code Clubs</a> located in <a href="https://www.latlong.net/c/?lat=33.074192&long=-112.014835">Maricopa, AZ</a>. Please <a href="https://m.me/copacoders">message us</a> or visit <a href="https://fb.me/copacoders">our Facebook page</a> if you are interested in volunteering or registering your child.</p>
        <h2>Dojo Members</h2>
        <p>We are a community-driven, all volunteer youth education club. We need many individuals working together to help youth in Maricopa creatively solve problems using technology that will drive them for years to come.</p>
        <h3>Ninjas</h3>
        <p>CoderDojos around the world are designed for kids ages 7 to 17 as they explore technology through coding, developing anything from websites to robots that learn the environment around them. We call our dojo participants <strong>Ninjas</strong> and they are the focus of everything we do in COPA CODERS. Ninjas come on a weekly basis to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>meet with like-minded people and discuss interests</li>
            <li>seek help with self-paced learning to accomplish goals</li>
            <li>develop goals and work toward them in a positive environment</li>
            <li>share accomplishments together with other <strong>Ninjas</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong style="color: red;">PLEASE NOTE:</strong> <strong>Ninjas</strong> under the age of 13 will need to be accompanied by a trusted adult for the duration of all Dojo events.</p>
        <h3>Mentors</h3>
        <p>The main pool of volunteers we would like to draw from are the parents of our <em>Ninjas</em>. While parents are encouraged to work alongside their ninjas, we need <strong>Mentors</strong> who are willing to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>set up and tear down tables and chairs each week</li>
            <li>communicate through social media with parents and ninjas</li>
            <li>direct ninjas to resources as they persue their interests</li>
            <li>share technical expertise, if any, they may have</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Really, <strong>Mentors</strong> can do anything that helps our <em>Ninjas</em> get more out of their journey.</p>
        <h3>Code Clubs</h3>
        <p>CoderDojo isn't the only youth organization started by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. While CoderDojos are focused on community and self-paced learning, Code Clubs are designed to supplement and encourage learning at school. Code Clubs are seen as sister organizations and we commit to help them and provide additional resources. All Code Club members in Maricopa are welcome at our Dojo and are considered members of <strong>COPA CODERS</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in starting a <strong>Code Club</strong> at your school and need help, please <a href="https://m.me/copacoders">contact us</a>.</p>
