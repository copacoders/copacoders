        <h1 id="top">COPA CODERS &mdash; CoderDojo</h1>
        <p class="callout"><a href="https://coderdojo.com/about/" target="_blank">CoderDojo Foundation</a> (CDF) is a member of the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> and is a global non-profit dedicated to youth technology education. While COPA CODERS is its own organization, we have signed the CDF Charter and, as such, adhere to the CoderDojo charter guidelines and ethos. We hope this helps you understand a little more about why we call ourselves a dojo and how being affiliated with this organization helps your child as he or she becomes a code ninja!</p>
        <h2 id="charter">Charter</h2>
        <article>
            <p>For the purposes of this Charter, "CoderDojo" shall mean the open source, volunteer led movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs. "Dojos" shall mean the not-for profit coding clubs established to support communities and spread the philosophy of CoderDojo.</p>
            <p>All Dojos are independent, autonomous, community groups set up to inspire young people to learn code. All Dojos have different styles of operating but they all hold the same ethos.</p>
